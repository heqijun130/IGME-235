a more fun version of T-Rex, Run! (Google Chrome Dinosaur Game)

### Proposal

#### High Concept
a more fun version of T-Rex, Run! (Google Chrome Dinosaur Game)

#### Story
the T-Rex is running away from the massive meteor which caused 
the extinction of Dinosaur. It is a sad story since we all know that the 
T-Rex is going to die due to the massive meteor no matter what you do. 
Players need to help this cute little T-Rex run away from the massive 
meteor. During the game, you will see many other Dinosaurs die along 
the way. If the T-Rex run far enough, he might survive since the game 
designer can make their own rule about the game.
               
              
#### Gameplay
The player can only jump. pressing space to jump, 
holding space for a big jump. there will be 
instruction at the beginning of the game.        

#### Other
It is a desktop-only platformer game, cartoonish style with 8-bit music.

#### About the developer
I am QiJun He, second-year game design. I don't have any skills. I like sleeping.

### Documentation

#### Process
The overall process of this project is steady. I got the idea of the game from the 
day I arrived at my apartment and there is no internet. The hardest part of the 
project is writing since English is not my first language. Also, I really tried to use 
grid in css but flexbox solves most of the problems.
