### Proposal

#### High Concept
a more fun version of T-Rex, Run! (Google Chorme Dinosaur Game)

#### Story
the T-Rex is running away from the massive meteor which caused the 
extinction of Dinosaur. It is a sad story since we all know that the 
T-Rex is going to die due to the massive meteor no matter what you do. 
Player need to help this cute little T-Rex run away from the massive 
meteor. During the game you will see many other Dinosaur die along the 
way. If the T-Rex run far enough, he might survive since the game designer 
can make their own rule about the game.
               
              
#### Gameplay
player can only jump. pressing space to jump, holding space for a big jump. 
there will be instruction in the beginning of the game.         

#### Other
it is a desktop only platformer game, cartoonish style with 8 bit music.

#### About the developer
I am QiJun He, second year game desgin. I don't have any skill. I like sleeping.

### Documentation

#### Process
The overall process of this project is steady. I got the idea of the game from 
the day I arrived at my appartment and there is no internet. The hardest part 
of the project is writing since English is not my first language. Also, I really 
tried to use grid in css but flexbox solve most of the problems.
